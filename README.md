# Arch Linux Setup

This is where I will provide documentation on my preferred setup of Arch. Of which some points may or may not be best practices or even correct :D.

## Pramble

A lot of this guide was "stolen" and modified from existing guides and wiki pages on the [Arch Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/)

>Proceed with caution as I'm an Arch Newbie still!
